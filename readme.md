This repository contains generated C++ resource code in games from ResourceGen in the final public version of the PopCap/SexyApp Framework. Names of files from game's that do not have compilation data will be guesses (pretty much all that's not PVZ's known betas). It's not possible to generate source files from Bejeweled Twist and most games beyond as ResourceMan2/ResourceGen3 is used which has parameters not known to ResourceGen.
